DATA TABLE
- Add a data table to show all data/delete rows under a selected node to all parent nodes. It should be sorted in the same order with the rows, so we can easily reason about the final state.

---

UI BUGS
- Pinch zoom is not working.
- Mouse pointer and the moving card are not in sync when dragging in zoomed in/out state.

---

SELECTION
- Support "pick-selection" by Cmd+click (or whichever shortcut is common).
- I think there is a bug in selection logic. We should be able to easily de-select by clicking outside or using the pick selection shortcut again.

---

EDGES BECOME INVISIBLE
- When children nodes are out of screen, their edges are also become invisible (hid immediately for some reason). It is misleading since it gives the impression that the parent node has no children at all.



---- FUTURE WORK ------------------------------------------------------------

- [MANUAL] Code cleanup & organization

PERFORMANCE
- Profile & improve performance by fixing most obvious points
- Profile & improve performance for big tables / graphs

NEW FEATURE
- Right-click node and open in explorer / finder.
- Add filtering capability on the graph (filter based on node type, single metadata hierarchy etc. etc.)
- Consider implementing different layouts

MORE PLATFORMS
- Consider making this project available as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin
