UX
- Pinch zoom is not working.
- Metadata node could point to multiple snapshots, and edges mix with each other. Resolve this UX problem somehow (using different colors etc.)


PERFORMANCE
- Profile & improve performance by fixing most obvious points
- Profile & improve performance for big tables / graphs


FEATURE
- Right-click node and open in explorer / finder.
- Add filtering capability on the graph (filter based on node type, single metadata hierarchy etc. etc.)
- Consider implementing different layouts


FUTURE WORK
- Consider making this project available as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin. (I can make it paid)
