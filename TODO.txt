UI BUGS
- Pinch zoom is not working (trackpad two finger gesture).
- To drag a node, I need to click once to select it first. I should be able to drag it immediately without the need to select it first.


---- FUTURE WORK ------------------------------------------------------------

- [MANUAL] Code cleanup & organization

PERFORMANCE
- Profile & improve performance by fixing most obvious points
- Profile & improve performance for big tables / graphs

NEW FEATURE
- Add filtering capability on the graph (filter based on node type, single metadata hierarchy etc. etc.)
- Consider implementing different layouts

MORE PLATFORMS
- Consider making this project available as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin
