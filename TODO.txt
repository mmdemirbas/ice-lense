- Metadata node could point to multiple snapshots, and edges mix with each other. Resolve this UX problem somehow (using different colors etc.)
- Pinch zoom is not working.
- Fix minimap.
- Improve node details by adding domain-specific table. For example data rows could be shown in a data file just like a database table, etc. Also add details from the json / avro lists items.
- Show children count on each node on UI
- Right-click node and open in explorer / finder.
- Add filtering capability on the graph (filter based on node type, single metadata hierarchy etc. etc.)
- Consider implementing different layouts

PERFORMANCE
- Consider performance for big tables / graphs.
- Performance considerations. This must be muc more performant. Profile and resolve the problem.
- Evaluate performance improvement options for a very big table.


FUTURE
- Consider making this project available as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin. (I can make it paid)
